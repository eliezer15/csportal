This is a prototype to show how ajax works and how we should probably set up the 
individual modules.

In order to run it, make sure you have dajax and dajaxice python libraries installed.

I've extensively commented on everything, the major files to look at are all under the Tutor app and they are:
1. tutor-ajax.js
2. ajax.py
3. All of the html templates
4. views.py
